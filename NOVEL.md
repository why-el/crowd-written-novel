It was a sunny May day when the man’s wife put out a missing person’s notice with the police. The policeman taking her statement had told her: “Don’t worry about a thing ma’am. However, should you fail to  hear from your husband or us in the next four weeks, do come back and file for our missing spouse reimbursements. This is a new program that the government has put into place. These reimbursements provide a year’s minimum wage, or roughly thirty-thousand dollars.” 

“Oh, thank you” The woman had replied confused while the man squeezed a handout of a man with teethy grin and a speech bubbule that read “Not quite the same as life insurance, but enough to get your family back on its feet!”.
