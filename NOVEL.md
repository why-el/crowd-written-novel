It was a sunny May day when Bill decided to take a walk.
He reached for his cane.
His fingers slowly curled around it one by one by one by one by one.
He took a deep breath.
He felt powerful.
Today was going to be good.
Suddenly, Bill felt his energy seeping away and he sank back into his porch chair.
Oh, what a comfortable chair it was.
He closed his eyes and sank slowly into a blissful slumber.

Dr. A sighed to himself. He isn't ready. He isn't ready.
