It was a sunny May day when Bill decided to take a walk. He reached for his cane and as he touched it, he disappeared into thin air. Two days went by and Bill's wife, now very concerned, walked into the police station to file a missing person's report. The policeman taking her statement had told her: “Don’t worry about a thing ma’am. However, should you fail to hear from your husband or us in the next four weeks, do come back and file for our missing spouse reimbursements. This is a new program that the government has put into place. These reimbursements provide a year’s minimum wage, or roughly thirty-thousand dollars.”

“Oh, thank you” The woman had replied confused while the man squeezed a handout of a man with teethy grin and a speech bubbule that read “Not quite the same as life insurance, but enough to get your family back on its feet!”.
