It was a sunny May day when Bill decided to take a walk. He reached for his cane, but his prosthetic arm wouldn't respond to his commands. "Ah, dammit," Bill thought, "I've got to get this thing serviced, and on my day off, too."

He stopped for a moment to look out at the view. Stars, and a dimmed sun - it was always beautiful. He was one of the lucky ones to have a window on the outer rim of Tachyon Station. Most of the staff had to settle for a screen. Many of them claimed to prefer it, but Bill was old-fashioned. He prefered to see the stars with his own eyes.
