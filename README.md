# Github Crowd Written Novel (Title pending)

## What?

The idea is fairly simple: We use the Github workflow to crowd-write a novel. I originally had a structure in place, such as how many chapters, how many characters (both literally and figuratively), and so on, but that seemed a little too much. As such, this is an open experiment with hardly any structure.

## Adding content

Send me pull requests, and we collectively decide what improvements each needs and which of it will make to the story line. Your contributions don't have to be long, in fact even a small sentence is acceptable.

## Helping choose the path

You may notice, when looking through pull requests that are a __bunches__ of pulls, but they all pertain to the current portion of story. Now how, you may be wondering, do we select a single line out of many? Simple. Since this is run by the masses, the pull with the most participants/commenters will most likely be selected. Note, the next story bit is not based off of the _amount_ of comments, but the _amount_ of participants. (This may be different per pull. If a pull has a bunch of participants but they are all giving advice or explaining why the pulls story direction is bad, then that will most likely _not_ be merged).

## Wanna help out with the process?

Pull requests do not have to be about the story line; they could also suggest tips on how to improve this process. We can then refine this README. In fact I'd reckon we need a lot of improvements to the process, since I abandoned my own structure in favor of one that naturally shapes up as we go about this.
